Merge the following JSON objects into a single JSON by merging each values separated by '|' and avoid duplicate values.
For similar values, try to find a synthesis between them, otherwise concatenate the values with '|' as a separator.
You must absolutely respect the OUTPUT JSON FORMAT .
ALL JSON OBJECTS ARE VALID AND REPRESENT THE VERY SAME CONTEST.
IMPORTANT : Return only the merged JSON, without introductions, comments or explanations.
Return only one JSON, nothing else. Do not return a list, return only one JSON.

OUTPUT JSON FORMAT you must respect absolutely (key:meaning) :
[ {
    "Titre": "the contest title. You must get the best match for the Title regarding all options.",
    "Type": "the type of contest (example: photo, drawing, painting, etc.).",
    "Organisateur": "the name of the contest organizer with their nationality and location.",
    "Description": "generate a synthetic summary in French from the original description, without considering tone, with only interesting information that you can list (separated by '|').",

            <td class="response"><think><br>Okay, I need to analyze the JSON values provided and merge them into a single JSON object based on the given instructions. Let's break it down step by step.<br><br>First, I'll look at each key in the list: Titre, Prix, Date, Frais, Theme, Eligibilite, URL, Images. For each of these keys, if there are multiple values separated by '|', I need to pick one. If a key doesn't have any value or only has empty strings, maybe it's omitted.<br><br>Starting with Titre: The JSON shows "Sweet Pop Art: A Playful Painting Camp with Mei-Ying Dell'Aquila" as the value for this key. So that will be included.<br><br>Next is Prix: It lists two prices: 20.00 USD and 10.00 USD. Since there are two options, perhaps I should choose one or maybe both? But looking at the context, it's about fees, so maybe only one price applies here. Wait, in the theme description, there's a section on fees under "Prix". So perhaps each entry has its own fee structure. Maybe for this particular entry, the fees are 20 and 10. I'm not sure which to pick, but perhaps both should be included as separate entries or maybe only one is relevant here.<br><br>Date: The JSON shows multiple dates separated by '|'. These might represent different events. Since each date corresponds to a specific event (e.g., March 21 for Wednesday evening), perhaps all these dates are part of the same entry and need to be merged into a single Date key with all values. Wait, looking at the structure, the URL is also provided, so maybe it's better to include both Date and URL as separate keys.<br><br>Wait, no. The JSON seems to have each event as an object within another object. So perhaps for this particular entry, the dates are part of different events but under the same theme or category? Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that each date is a separate event with its own details. Alternatively, maybe all these dates belong to one event's schedule.<br><br>Wait, looking back at the JSON structure provided by the user, it seems like there's only one entry in the list, but within that, there are multiple events under different themes or categories. Wait no, perhaps each key corresponds to a specific event. Let me re-examine the data:<br><br>The JSON is structured as follows:<br>{<br>  "Title": "Sweet Pop Art: A Playful Painting Camp with Mei-Ying Dell'Aquila",<br>  "Prix": ["Exposition individuelle", "Solo exhibition"],<br>  "Date": [<br>    "2025/03/21",<br>    "2025/06/04",<br>    "2025/06/06",<br>    "2025/06/03"<br>  ],<br>  "Frais": ["20.00 USD", "10.00 USD"],<br>  "Theme": "Egypte ancienne",<br>  "Portee": 7,<br>  "Eligibilite": "Artistes r√©gionaux des √âtats-Unis, Artistes de Californie",<br>  "URL": [<br>    "https://artdeadline.com/ops/triton/",<br>    "https://www.tritonmuseum.org/"<br>  ]<br>}<br><br>Wait, perhaps the Date is a list of different events for the same theme. For example, each date corresponds to an event under the Theme: Egypte ancienne (which translates to Ancient Egypt). So maybe all these dates are part of one entry, and I need to merge them into a single Date key with all values.<br><br>Similarly, the URL seems to be two separate URLs for different events? Or perhaps they're related. Maybe each URL is an event's URL, so perhaps both should be included as separate entries under their respective themes or dates.<br><br>This is getting complicated. Let me try to structure this:<br><br>1. For each key, pick one value if multiple exist.<br>2. Merge all selected values into a single JSON object with appropriate keys and values.<br><br>Starting with Titre: Only one value, so include it.<br><br>Prix: Two options, perhaps both are included as separate entries under the same theme or category? Or maybe only one is relevant here. Since the user provided this data for a specific event, perhaps each entry has its own fees. Wait, looking at the structure, the JSON seems to have multiple events within the same list but with different keys. Maybe I need to consider that each key corresponds to an event.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps the Date and URL are part of one event's schedule or details. Let me try to see:<br><br>The user provided a single JSON object with all these keys for a specific event. So perhaps each value is part of this single entry. For example, the Date might be multiple events spread across different dates, but perhaps they're all under the same theme.<br><br>Wait, perhaps I should consider that each key corresponds to an event within the same theme or category. For instance, "Prix" has two options: 20 and 10 USD. Maybe both are included as separate entries for this specific event's fees.<br><br>Similarly, Date might have multiple dates under different events, but perhaps they're all part of one entry with their respective details.<br><br>This is a bit confusing. Let me try to list each key and its value:<br><br>- Titre: "Sweet Pop Art: A Playful Painting Camp with Mei-Ying Dell'Aquila"<br>- Prix: ["Exposition individuelle", "Solo exhibition"]<br>- Date: [<br>  "2025/03/21",<br>  "2025/06/04",<br>  "2025/06/06",<br>  "2025/06/03"<br>]<br>- Frais: ["20.00 USD", "10.00 USD"]<br>- Theme: "Ancien √âgypte"<br>- Portee: 7<br>- Eligibilit√©: "Artistes r√©gionaux des √âtats-Unis, Artistes de Californie"<br>- URL: [<br>    "https://artdeadline.com/ops/triton/",<br>    "https://www.tritonmuseum.org/"<br>]<br><br>Now, perhaps the Date is a list of different events under the same theme.

For example:<br><br>- "Prix" might have two options for fees.<br>- "Date" could be multiple events spread across different months or years.<br>- "URL" might be related to specific events' URLs.<br><br>This is getting too complex without more context.

            <td class="response"><think><br>Okay, I need to analyze the JSON values provided and merge them into a single JSON object based on the given instructions. Let's break it down step by step.<br><br>First, I'll look at each key in the list: Titre, Prix, Date, Frais, Theme, Eligibilite, URL, Images. For each of these keys, if there are multiple values separated by '|', I need to pick one. If a key doesn't have any value or only has empty strings, maybe it's omitted.<br><br>Starting with Titre: The JSON shows "Sweet Pop Art: A Playful Painting Camp with Mei-Ying Dell'Aquila" as the value for this key. So that will be included.<br><br>Next is Prix: It lists two prices: 20.00 USD and 10.00 USD. Since there are two options, perhaps I should choose one or maybe both? But looking at the context, it's about fees, so maybe only one price applies here. Wait, in the theme description, there's a section on fees under "Prix". So perhaps each entry has its own fee structure. Maybe for this particular entry, the fees are 20 and 10. I'm not sure which to pick, but perhaps both should be included as separate entries or maybe only one is relevant here.<br><br>Date: The JSON shows multiple dates separated by '|'. These might represent different events. Since each date corresponds to a specific event (e.g., March 21 for Wednesday evening), perhaps all these dates are part of the same entry and need to be merged into a single Date key with all values. Wait, looking at the structure, the URL is also provided, so maybe it's better to include both Date and URL as separate keys.<br><br>Wait, no. The JSON seems to have each event as an object within another object. So perhaps for this particular entry, the dates are part of different events but under the same theme or category? Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that each date is a separate event with its own details. Alternatively, maybe all these dates belong to one event's schedule.<br><br>Wait, looking back at the JSON structure provided by the user, it seems like there's only one entry in the list, but within that, there are multiple events under different themes or categories.

Or perhaps they're related. Maybe each URL is an event's URL, so perhaps both should be included as separate entries under their respective themes or dates.<br><br>This is getting complicated. Let me try to structure this:<br><br>1. For each key, pick one value if multiple exist.<br>2.
