    "response": " <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this JSON merging task. The user wants all the useful information about contests merged into a single JSON object, focusing on specific keys. First, I need to go through each provided JSON and extract the relevant data.\n\nStarting with the 'Titre' key. The original value has multiple titles separated by '|'. I should list them as an array to keep all options. Next, 'Prix' has entries like \"Exposition individuelle\" and \"Solo exhibition\". These seem similar, so maybe combine them into a single string mentioning both in French and English.\n\nLooking at 'Date', there are several dates listed. The main submission deadline is March 21, 2025, which is the most critical date. Other dates might be part of event schedules but since the user didn't specify handling multiple dates, I'll prioritize the submission deadline.\n\nFor 'Frais', the entry fees are $20 and $10 for additional entries. I need to present this clearly, perhaps as a formatted string indicating the per-entry cost. \n\nThe 'URL' key has two URLs. Since both are relevant (one for deadlines and one for the museum), I'll list them in an array to include all.\n\nNow, checking other keys like 'Theme', which includes painting, drawing, etc., and 'Eligibilite' with regional artists. These should be combined into arrays if there are multiple entries separated by '|'.\n\nThe 'Description' from the original JSON is quite detailed, but the user didn't mention it as a required key. However, since the task is to include all useful info, maybe extract key points like entry fees, notification dates, and exhibition details.\n\nWait, the user specified only certain keys: Titre, Prix, Date, Frais, URL, Theme, Eligibilite. So I should focus on those. Let me ensure each of these keys is addressed properly.\n\nFor 'Theme', combining all listed themes into an array. Similarly, 'Eligibilite' should have both entries as separate items in an array.\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON should have each key with merged and formatted values where necessary.

First, I need to go through each provided JSON and extract the relevant data.\n\nStarting with the 'Titre' key. The original value has multiple titles separated by '|'.
